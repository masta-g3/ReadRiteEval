Using a second monitor at work enhances multitasking efficiency.,"[{'evidence': 'A productivity study that found employees completed tasks 20% faster when using dual monitors.', 'supports': 'Supports', 'validation': {'analysis': 'The productivity study showing that employees completed tasks 20% faster with dual monitors provides empirical support for the hypothesis that using a second monitor at work enhances multitasking efficiency.

This expert opinion does not outright support the hypothesis that using a second monitor at work enhances multitasking efficiency, nor does it outright refute it; instead, it highlights that the benefit varies based on individual circumstances.
